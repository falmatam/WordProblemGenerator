# WordProblemGenerator

Project Requirements:

After having made your own UML design(s), implement someone else's design, making changes (minor or major) as needed. 

This implementation incldues an I/O console version of a WPG (Word Problem Generator), allowing a user to specify relevant "Names" and "Items" as well as choices of "Operation Types" to generate worksheets with names and items that interest them, making the questions more personable and, ultimately, easier to answer.Upon completing a worksheet, a score card is generated in the working directory for the administrators reference.

This is a very useful tool for children in the elementary school level!

Implemented design can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/falmatam/WordProgramGenerator/blob/master/design.pdf">here</a>. Enjoy!
